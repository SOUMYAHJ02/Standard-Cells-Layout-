Standard Cells Layouts in UMC 180nm Technology
The design of layouts for various logic gates including inverter, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, AND and OR was
carried out by employing standard cell layout techniques.
These techniques includes fixed cell height, placement of N-Well as well as placement VDD and VSS.
The cells were designed to meet DRC and LVS Specifications.
